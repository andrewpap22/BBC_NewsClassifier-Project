     ---------------------------------------------------------------

        So In this directory you can find, this README.md file and:
        the 4 jupyter notebooks that implement the whole project! 
	
	 

       **Analysis:**
        ----------

        **01-DataAnalysis_WordClouds.ipynb:**
        (So on this 1st notebook you can find me implementing data analysis
         on the dataset that we were given + generating the 5 wordclouds)

        **02-FeatureEngineering.ipynb:**
        (Here i've done some extra feature engineering on the dataset so
         we can move on to the classification part of the project)

        **03-Model_Training_Classification.ipynb:**
        (Here the 2nd, 3rd parts of the project are implemented.
         Everything is very well commented and with brief explanations
         on everything done, inside the notebook)

        and lastly:

        **04-Clustering.ipynb:**
        (The 4th and last part of the project is implemented inside,
         this notebook + the bonus part.)

        As said, everything is well commented and brief epxlanations are
        included on each of the 4 notebooks for each and every part that is
        implemented.

        **[extra]** ----> I've added an img directory that contains 2 gif files
                          used in the clustering notebook that represent the clustering in 3D space alongside the 2D asked!

	*Just check the notebooks and don't bother with anything else! 
	Thank you!*
